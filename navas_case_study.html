    </div>

    <div class="case-study-content">
        <p>This case study demonstrates how Real Madrid's coaching staff used xT-GK analysis to prepare Keylor Navas for optimal distribution against Atlético Madrid's aggressive pressing system. By combining data analysis with practical coaching, the team developed a targeted distribution strategy that maximized possession retention while creating progressive opportunities.</p>

        <h4>The Analysis Process</h4>
        <p>Real Madrid's goalkeeper coach and data analyst conducted a comprehensive review of Atlético Madrid's pressing patterns from their previous 12 matches. Using the xT-GK framework, they identified:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pressing Triggers:</strong> Atlético consistently initiated high pressure when the ball was played to specific zones (highlighted in red on the heat map)</li>
            <li><strong>Pressing Intensity:</strong> 68% of Atlético's pressing sequences involved 3+ players within 5 seconds of goalkeeper possession</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerable Zones:</strong> Areas where Atlético's press could be exploited due to positioning gaps (highlighted in green)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Key Distribution Recommendations</h4>
        <p>Based on the xT-GK analysis, the coaching staff provided Navas with specific distribution instructions:</p>

        <div class="distribution-scenarios">
            <div class="scenario">
                <h5>Under High Pressure (≤2 seconds, opponents within 5m)</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Short lateral passes to center-backs positioned in half-spaces (xT-GK: 0.42)</li>
                    <li>Success probability: 91% with proper receiver positioning</li>
                    <li>Risk avoidance parameter (δ): 0.7 to prioritize security</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="scenario">
                <h5>Under Medium Pressure (2-5 seconds, opponents 5-10m away)</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diagonal passes to full-backs in advanced positions (xT-GK: 0.57)</li>
                    <li>Success probability: 78% with coordinated movement patterns</li>
                    <li>Pressure escape value (PEV): 0.31 (above team average of 0.25)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="scenario">
                <h5>Under Low Pressure (≥5 seconds, no opponents within 10m)</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Central progression to defensive midfielders (xT-GK: 0.63)</li>
                    <li>Success probability: 85% with proper positioning</li>
                    <li>Temporal sequence value: 0.72 when followed by progressive passes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Team Coordination Elements</h4>
        <p>The analysis session included defensive players to ensure coordinated movement patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Center-backs:</strong> Positioning adjustments to create optimal passing angles</li>
            <li><strong>Full-backs:</strong> Timing of forward movements based on pressure recognition</li>
            <li><strong>Defensive midfielders:</strong> Dropping patterns to create central progression options</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Match Implementation</h4>
        <p>During the actual match against Atlético Madrid, Navas successfully implemented the distribution strategy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>24 distributions under varying pressure levels</li>
            <li>86% overall success rate (compared to season average of 79%)</li>
            <li>0.58 average xT-GK value (compared to season average of 0.49)</li>
            <li>4 high-value sequences leading directly to attacking opportunities</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Practical Outcomes</h4>
        <p>The pre-match analysis and preparation resulted in:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Improved Decision-Making:</strong> Navas made distribution choices aligned with the xT-GK recommendations in 92% of situations</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Team Coordination:</strong> Defenders positioned themselves optimally for distribution in 88% of scenarios</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure Resistance:</strong> Successfully bypassed Atlético's press in 76% of high-pressure situations</li>
            <li><strong>Possession Progression:</strong> Achieved 23% more progressive possessions from goalkeeper distribution compared to season average</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="conclusion">This case study illustrates how the xT-GK framework bridges the gap between advanced analytics and practical on-field application, providing goalkeepers and coaches with actionable insights for match preparation.</p>
